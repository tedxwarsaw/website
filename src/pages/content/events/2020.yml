description:
  In today's World challenges are now coming at us constantly, and from
  every direction. To deal with them in the time-honoured way of "wait and
  see" is no longer a viable option. Solutions to housing problems, social
  inequality, cultural tensions and environmental pollution are only going
  to be found if we dare to face the problems, instead of waiting for
  someone to figure out the way forward. To lead is to dare, to hope is to
  dare. To solve problems is to dare.
