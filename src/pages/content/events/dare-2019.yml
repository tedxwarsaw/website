hook: "In today's World challenges are now coming at us constantly, and from
  every direction. "
description: To deal with them in the time-honoured way of "wait and see" is no
  longer a viable option. Solutions to housing problems, social inequality,
  cultural tensions and environmental pollution are only going to be found if we
  dare to face the problems, instead of waiting for someone to figure out the
  way forward. To lead is to dare, to hope is to dare. To solve problems is to
  dare.
