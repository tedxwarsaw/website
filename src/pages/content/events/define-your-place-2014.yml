description: TEDxWarsaw team hosted a very special TEDx event, at the invitation
  of the President of the Republic of Poland. Organised with the assistance of
  the President's office but entirely independent in terms of theme, selection
  of speakers, and every other aspect, this was a unique public event held at
  the country's highest office.
