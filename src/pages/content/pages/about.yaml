  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local,
  self-organized events that bring people together

  to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion

  and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

  The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.

  TEDxWarsaw has a focus on topics related to the city of Warsaw and its surroundings, but also caters to bring ideas,

  knowledge and talks about broader topics.




  **We hope to connect you to our knowledge thirsty audience and uncover exhilarating, fascinating and eye-opening topics together.**




  Our main event - TEDxWarsaw Conference - is a series of short talks, ranging from approximately five to eighteen

  minutes in length. In between speakers you will have the opportunity to enjoy performances, eat some eclectic food

  choices and wander around our creatively inspired event spaces. From time to time we organize also online debates to discuss

  the most important topics right here, right now.

      I work with IT and engineering leaders to build rock-star teams, increase
      job satisfaction and reduce turnover. Together we remove stumbling blocks
      to co-create a path forward.



      I have spent more than a decade working with leadership teams for corporations such as Procter and Gamble, Motorola and Heineken. I have designed and delivered learning experiences for college students as part of AIESEC Poland, the largest student organization in the world. Most recently, I coached seven clean energy startup founders prior to their investment pitches at InnoEnergy 2020.



      I'm the core team leader of TEDxWarsaw and I’m proud to mention that in 2019, 500 professionals attended the sold-out event.



      I am passionate about helping people communicate and be more understanding towards each other’s needs.

    title: Speakers Lead
    description: >-
      I’m a qualified facilitator and coach (PCC ICF) with plenty of media and
      stage experience. I

      have spent a total of over 1,000 hours working with my clients. I support those who perform

      in public, including musicians, actors, managers, lecturers, lawyers. I also provide training for

      companies.

      After years of musical education, first in the cello class and then in jazz vocals, I was the

      only Polish woman to get a role in a Cuban musical. Today, I find it more satisfying to help

      people behind the scenes than to be on the actual stage. Hence my presence in the

      TEDxWarsaw team. I don't think there is one recipe for successful performances and how to

      deal with stress and criticism, but individual work can do wonders. You can count on me in

      this respect.

      I own three businesses: Mały Geniusz (Little Genius), Salon Przytulania (Hug Salon) and

      SztukaWystapien.pl. After hours, I’m a big fan of tea, lindy hop, natural ice-cream and

      cinema.

    title: Marketing Lead
    description: >-
      Marketing and PR is what I love and can make into real business. My areas
      of specialization

      include strategic consulting, content marketing, social media and non-standard forms of

      communication for consumer brands and B2B SaaS companies. Most often I support them

      "from the inside" as a shadow consultant. I particularly enjoy designing processes that

      streamline cooperation between marketing and sales.

      And since I like to share my knowledge, I also teach Internet Marketing to postgraduate

      students at the AGH University of Science and Technology and Bialystok University of

      Technology. Before that, for 4 years I was responsible for Prowly’s marketing and content

      marketing strategy on the global market and headed an international public relations portal.

      At TEDxWarsaw I’m all for building a community and creating a proper buzz around our

      initiative. After hours I co-drive an oldtimer, a blue MX5, and host a podcast called Szczypta.

      You can also listen to me at Facebook Talks which I have the pleasure to host.

    title: Partnership Lead
    description: >-
      A philosopher by education and passion. I appreciate the ability to think
      logically and

      critically, I like to ask questions and enjoy learning different perspectives. At TEDxWarsaw, I

      am most driven by the variety of topics and simply interesting people, whether among the

      organizers, guests or participants. I know how to link our values to the values of brands that

      want to get involved in our initiative, which is why I’m responsible for partnerships.

      By working day I’m involved in marketing and sales, and in between all these activities I

      develop my interest in new technologies. Privately I love dogs, short films, books and good

      magazines, but most of all – travelling.

    title: Finance Lead
    description: >-
      An economist by education, and after hours a passionate books and LEGO
      fan. Both of

      these passions are a result of me nurturing an undisturbed childish curiosity about the world.

      I joined TEDxWarsaw because I appreciate the opportunity to meet new interesting people

      and like every child I want to make a change in the world. I support the team in the area of

      financials.

      By working day I have been gaining experience in various areas of supply chain

      management in one of the largest FMCG companies on the market. During my studies I

      dealt with finances at AIESEC Poland. The people I look up to are Carl Sagan, Stefan

      Banach and Terry Pratchett.

      You either love him or hate him!

      Chaos management aka daily reality in the event business is something they won't teach

      you at the Warsaw University, though this is where Marek honed his solid skills ;)

      He works in advertising, however he is not very fond of paid influencers.

      He enjoys playing golf, and now works on a system to manage golf courses.

      Ground traveler – his Defender made him an amateur youtuber-mechanic - follow him here

      https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbPyXi7C9H8SSYE2FQ-cuGcc84A0LjHx_

      His kids are so cool he has three – more can't fit in the Defender, but thankfully there’s

      always room for Floki, their extremely loud Bavarian Mountain Hound.

      school. In previous

      years, he was responsible for volunteer matters, registration process and the website. By

      working day, education and current responsibilities at TEDxWarsaw he is a computer

      programmer. He likes indie pop, and spends his after-hours reading fantasy books and

      technology blogs.

    title: Legal Lead
    description: >-
      After I took part in the first TEDxWarsaw in 2018, I decided I wanted to
      contribute to the next

      editions and since then I have supported the initiative in formal and legal matters.

      I am a lawyer and now also an attorney-at-law in training. In my work I combine law and new

      technologies, and in the future I will focus on my own innovative business.

      Privately, I am a huge car fan, I listen to all kinds of music and once in a while I like to take a

      break from civilization and spend time in nature. I also like gangster and SF movies.
