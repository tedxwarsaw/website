aboutTedWarsawContent: |
  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together
  to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion
  and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.
  The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.
  TEDxWarsaw has a focus on topics related to the city of Warsaw and its surroundings, but also caters to bring ideas,
  knowledge and talks about broader topics.



  **We hope to connect you to our knowledge thirsty audience and uncover exhilarating, fascinating and eye-opening topics together.**



  Our main event - TEDxWarsaw Conference - is a series of short talks, ranging from approximately five to eighteen
  minutes in length. In between speakers you will have the opportunity to enjoy performances, eat some eclectic food
  choices and wander around our creatively inspired event spaces. From time to time we organize also online debates to discuss
  the most important topics right here, right now.

        I work with IT and engineering leaders to build rock-star teams, increase job satisfaction and reduce turnover. Together we remove stumbling blocks to co-create a path forward.



        I have spent more than a decade working with leadership teams for corporations such as Procter and Gamble, Motorola and Heineken. I have designed and delivered learning experiences for college students as part of AIESEC Poland, the largest student organization in the world. Most recently, I coached seven clean energy startup founders prior to their investment pitches at InnoEnergy 2020.



        I'm the core team leader of TEDxWarsaw and I’m proud to mention that in 2019, 500 professionals attended the sold-out event.



        I am passionate about helping people communicate and be more understanding towards each other’s needs.
