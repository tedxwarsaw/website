        I work with IT and engineering leaders to build rock-star teams, increase job satisfaction and reduce turnover. Together we remove stumbling blocks to co-create a path forward.



        I have spent more than a decade working with leadership teams for corporations such as Procter and Gamble, Motorola and Heineken. I have designed and delivered learning experiences for college students as part of AIESEC Poland, the largest student organization in the world. Most recently, I coached seven clean energy startup founders prior to their investment pitches at InnoEnergy 2020.



        I'm the core team leader of TEDxWarsaw and I’m proud to mention that in 2019, 500 professionals attended the sold-out event.



        I am passionate about helping people communicate and be more understanding towards each other’s needs.
