displayName: Live Music in your Living Room
talkDescription: Can you picture your office or maybe your living room as a
  concert hall? Anna Wysocka has livened up people's living and work spaces with
  the performances by over fifty artists, allowing them and the audience to
  experience music in an unprecedented way.   Sofar Sounds bills itself as a
  global movement that brings music to intimate spaces, and Anna Wysocka is
  doing this in Warsaw.  This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED
  conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more
