displayName: Does "Where" Influence "How"?
talkDescription: Over fifty thousand square metres of workspaces and a hundred
  studies of patterns of work and the use of space in Polish companies have
  given Bogusz unique knowledge of how we can create smart spaces at human
  scale. He has spent three years as both publisher and managing editor of the
  workspace design magazine OFFICE and now leads his own team, transforming the
  spaces we work in and making them a bit (OK, a lot) more flexible and
  enjoyable.
