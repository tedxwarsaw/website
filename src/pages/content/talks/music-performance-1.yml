talkDescription: "Pop-up Books perform their second ever live show in front of
  the TEDxWarsaw audience. Songs performed were You Are The Summer, Don't Follow
  Me, Bridge Will Burn, 100 Echoes, and Without You.  *Due to issues with Front
  of House, and with the monitoring on stage, the audio of the performance is
  uneven and, on a couple of occasions, drops out briefly*  Seattle-born Jules
  Jones (vocals / bass) and Scottish émigré Neil Milton (vocals / guitar) formed
  Pop-up Books in Warsaw in early 2019, after drafting in Poles, Tomek
  Dorobczyński (drums) and Maurycy Bór (guitar) to complete the line-up. "

speakerDescription: Pop-up Books have a love for harmony-rich, 60s-inspired
  indie-pop. C86 dreaming of '68, you might say. This talk was given at a TEDx
  event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local
  community.
