displayName: What to Do About the Baltic
talkDescription: Finnish oceanographer Hanna Paulomäki has been focusing on the
  severe and urgent problems which plague the Baltic Sea. Lack of an organised
  approach to fishing and marine protection has resulted in a woeful state for
  this body of water; Hanna and her colleagues are working to change that.
