  Described as having a vocal range beyond some of Poland's greatest jazz divas,

  as varied as traditional 'drum talk' of Northern India and medieval chorales,
  and relishes an approach to the voice as an instrument.

speakerDescription: In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of
  local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like
  experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark
  deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized
  events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED
  Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx
  events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
