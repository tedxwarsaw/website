displayName: How to stop being afraid of former prisoners?
talkDescription: For the last ten years Maciej Sopyło has had a unique
  opportunity to observe life behind bars. Before you think you have him pegged,
  let us tell you that he is actually a youth and adult trainer and a Ph.D
  student at the Institute of Law Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences.
  Catering to his own desire to learn about the lives of convicts, he tries to
  figure out how to prepare them for life outside.  Maciej Sopyło is an activist
  who has had a unique opportunity to observe life behind bars.  This talk was
  given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently
  organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx
