displayName: Time to use your superpower
talkDescription: "We  all feel that the world is divided. But the division does
  not go where we think. The main dividing line is not possession and poverty,
  religion or politics. The most important and most dangerous division is among
  the people who have a sense of having a superpower and those who feel
  helpless. "
