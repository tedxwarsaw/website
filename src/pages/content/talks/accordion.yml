displayName: Accordion
talkDescription: The first ever accordionist to play solo accompanied by the
  National Philharmonic Orchestra of Warsaw, Paweł Janas knows how to harness
  the forces of vacuum and pressure to create most seductive vibrations and
  indulge in aerophonic experiments with uncommon instrumental duos. In Paweł`s
  hands, the accordion becomes modern and striking.

speakerDescription: In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of
  local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like
  experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark
  deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized
  events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED
  Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx
  events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
