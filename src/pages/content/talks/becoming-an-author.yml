displayName: Becoming an author
talkDescription: Christian Dumais -- writer, humorist and lecturer though his
  own fame is overshadowed by the hulking greatness of his invention @DRUNKHULK
  who seems to have an opinion on everything. Christian balances 'serious'
  writing and teaching courses in language and popular culture with a steady
  output of green goodness which pokes fun at life's absurdities.

speakerDescription: In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of
  local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like
  experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark
  deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized
  events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED
  Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx
  events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
