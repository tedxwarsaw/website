speakerDescription: "Jakub Stefek is an organ student at the Fryderyk Chopin
  University of Music, where he has been the Chairman of the Students’ Council
  for two years. He has taken part in many competitions and music courses. He
  divides his time between solitary work on his instrument and meetings and
  conversations with people of diverse professions, trades and walks of life.
  Where these activities meet, his reflections about culture and its creators
  come to life. Thanks to his company management studies at the Warsaw School of
  Economics, he slowly works on making his dream come true: to be a total
  manager of culture, knowing the art inside out and shaping it according to the
  times we live in. This is the question which, using the example of organ
  music, he discusses in his Master’s Thesis. The art of creativity in
  disciplines and times seemingly buried in history forever.  This talk was
  given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently
  organized by a local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
