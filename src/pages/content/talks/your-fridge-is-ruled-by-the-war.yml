displayName: Your Fridge is Ruled by the War
talkDescription: Aleksandra collects old cookbooks and handbooks for housewives
  and reads the same newspapers as our great-grandmothers did, literally. All
  this has served as inspiration for some of the two hundred articles she has
  written, for numerous current affairs and history magazines. Her main point?
  What and how we eat, or more precisely, store and prepare our food, is steeped
  in unconscious remembering of our parent's wartime trauma.
