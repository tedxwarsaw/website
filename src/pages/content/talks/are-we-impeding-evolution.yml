displayName: Are we Impeding Evolution?
talkDescription: Szymon is well placed to study how environmental changes
  influence our evolutionary success and our chances of survival, and explains
  his, purely scientific, mind you, fascination with the benefits of marital
  cheating (in certain circumstances, of course.) His affinity for artistic
  forms of data presentation and scientific illustrations make him an ideal
  populariser of science.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED
  conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more
