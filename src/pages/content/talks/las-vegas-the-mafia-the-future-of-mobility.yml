displayName: Las Vegas, the mafia & the future of mobility
talkDescription: "From the mafia luring people into the desert (or what then
  become Las Vegas) to online shopping.  What is the link? Mobility.  This is
  the story about Warren Bayley who found a way to compete against the mob.  In
  1961, he made Vegas more accessible to more people thanks to free flights.  He
  updated the business model from entertainment to mobility and literally
  carried people directly to his casino.  That changed the way businesses
  thought about mobility and helped to realize that mobility improves customer
  experience. Today we get the free shipping when shopping online.  In 2025,
  we  are going to get a free ride to a shop or a restaurant. Businesses will
  give us a choice to have an experience in a real world or to stay in. Real
  world will become as accessible as digital thanks to free mobility. "
