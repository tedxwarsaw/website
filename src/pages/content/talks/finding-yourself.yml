speakerDescription: Yuri is currently serving as creative director at a leading
  Polish social media agency.  In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a
  program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a
  TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine
  to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local,
  self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED
  event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but
  individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and
  regulations)
