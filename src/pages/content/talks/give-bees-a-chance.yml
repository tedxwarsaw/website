displayName: Give Bees a Chance
talkDescription: In 2014 Kamil's first hive appeared in the Warsaw suburb of
  Mokot√≥w and now, in addition to running beekeeping workshops and an
  educational programme, Kamil is looking after some fifty hives in total; some
  of them are in private gardens dotted around the city but others stand in the
  strangest places, including roofs of shopping malls.  Fascinated with all
  things bee for two decades, Kamil Baj finally took a gamble in 2013, and
  became an urban beekeeper.
