speakerDescription: "Woodsmoke Avantgarde Trio is a project founded by two young
  musicians from Poland accompanied by a few other instrumentalists. Their goal
  is to mix dense old-time ambience with progressive melodies and rhythms into
  music sought by fans of modern instrumental art. To achieve this they exploit
  sounds of different acoustic instruments: from piano, guitars and strings to
  accordion, flutes and cellos. Their inspiration comes from many genres such as
  ambient, jazz, post rock, folk and classical music. They have just finished
  working on their debut album â€™Places from a distance'.  This talk was given at
  a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a
  local community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
