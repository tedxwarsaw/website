displayName: Identity and judgment in the 21st century
talkDescription: For better or worse, what we do has become who we are. As
  humans we are wired to think in categories. When we categorize each other by
  what we ‘do', we shape how we think of each other. Titles we use are not
  descriptions of who we are, it is a ‘judgement’ of who we are. Identity and
  judgment are two sides of the same coin.
