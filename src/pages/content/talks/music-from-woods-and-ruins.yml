displayName: Music from Woods and Ruins
talkDescription: "Shivers and Shakes' original sound combines elements of folk,
  post rock and other influences. The duo weaves together vocals, electronica
  and spacial guitar to arrive in a space that is full of mood and imagination.
  Their music, they say, comes from long hours of improvisation among woods and
  ruins of Poland's countryside. You can find them on Soundcloud here:
