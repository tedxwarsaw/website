talkDescription: In Jacek Szycht`s photographs, every single creature captured
  by the camera comes across as photosexual. Casting the spell of light and
  shadow on a daily basis, Jacek finds inspiration in music and colour trends in
  fashion. His recent project merges his love for stories encapsulated in images
  and his life-long ambition to travel in time.

speakerDescription: In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of
  local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like
  experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark
  deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized
  events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED
  Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx
  events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
