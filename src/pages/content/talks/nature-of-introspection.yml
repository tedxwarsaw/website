speakerDescription: " In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program
  of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like
  experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark
  deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized
  events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED
  Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx
  events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)"
