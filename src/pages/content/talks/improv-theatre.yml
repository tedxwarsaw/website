speakerDescription: " HOFESINKA is a group of comedians performing one of the
  most spectacular and lively types of comedy â€“ improvisation. Improv is a
  performance created live, by actors making it up in front of the audience.
  Constant interaction with the viewers, their active contributions to the show
  and the choice of topics limited only by imagination guarantee quality fun
  regardless of time, place and circumstances. Trained at the famous iO Chicago
  improvisational theatre, they define their style as a combination of the
  Chicago and Lublin-Mazovian improv schools.  This talk was given at a TEDx
  event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local
  community. Learn more at http://ted.com/tedx"
