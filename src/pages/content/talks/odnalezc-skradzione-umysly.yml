speakerDescription: Kinga Panasiewicz is a young neuroscientist who conducts
  research on how the cognitive and behavioral functions depend on neural
  impulses in the brain. Her research project represented Poland during the
  Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in Phoenix, Arizona in 2013,
  where it won the second prize in Medicine and Health Sciences. In recognition
  of her work, MIT Lincoln Laboratory named a recently discovered planetoid
  (29762) ‘Panasiewicz’. She successfully represented Poland at the World
  Neuroscience Competition in Washington and was awarded a scholarship by the
  Minister of Education. Kinga actively popularizes knowledge about the brain
  and supports foundations which improve the quality of life for people with
  brain diseases. In 2014 she appeared on New Europe 100, the list of Central
  and Eastern Europe's top 100 innovators, co-created by Google, Financial
  Times, Visegrad Fund, Res Publica Nowa magazine and many other European
  institutions.  This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference
  format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at
